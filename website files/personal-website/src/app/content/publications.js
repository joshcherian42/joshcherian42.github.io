    abstract:
      "BVI (blind and visually impaired) persons do not have the same degree of access to concepts and procedures in learning algebraic equations as sighted persons. As tactile resources are uncommon, most rely on auditory-based methods that place heavy stress on working memory. We propose a novel approach that leverages haptic technology to communicate mathematical symbols via vibrotactile patterns; this design addresses open challenges found in existing resources for BVI people and explores the potential utility of this medium for all users. We conducted three separate studies to evaluate the feasibility of our gloves that included BVI participants. The outcomes of our studies yielded insightful design discussions, including a blind participant who found the device immediately intuitive and exciting in potential.",

    abstract:
      "Creatives often struggle with fixation on a narrow set of ideas. There is potential for co-creative systems to stimulate creatives in new and powerful ways. We sought to lay a foundation for such systems with an exploratory study. We recruited 20 university students and asked them to rapidly draw a series of creature concepts with two technology probes, one of which generates ambiguous stimuli from user strokes. We analyzed the 240 sketches visually and discovered that while most participants were fixated on humanoid forms, those that began sketching with the ambiguous stimuli first were provoked to explore more unusual varieties (p < 0.01). We also interviewed participants and used thematic analysis to analyze the data. While some participants resisted the partial loss of control and freedom, most believed the stimuli encouraged more divergent exploration and holistic thinking, and they acknowledged their potential benefit in the earliest stages of the ideation process.",
